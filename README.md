# Pitahaya production analysis
In this project, the different production areas of the pitahaya post-harvest process in the province of Morona-Santiago are 
analyzed. From this, the washing and disinfection, classification and packaging threads are automated to reduce manual work 
and maintain quality, considering the requirements for export to countries such as the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia.
Based on the above, the process control is designed with ladder programming for PLCs and both the current post-harvest 
process, and the new process are simulated to verify the changes in their idle times, production quantity and production flow.
